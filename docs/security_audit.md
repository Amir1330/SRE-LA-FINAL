# Security Audit Report

**Date**: May 16, 2025  
**Conducted by**: Iskakov Amir, Zholtaev Temirlan  
**Target**: SRE Demo Application  
**Classification**: Internal Document  

## Executive Summary

This security audit evaluates the SRE Demo Application from a security perspective, identifying vulnerabilities and providing recommendations. The application consists of a Flask backend, React frontend, and supporting infrastructure deployed on AWS.

Overall, the application has medium security risk with several critical issues identified that should be addressed before production deployment.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

1. **Insecure Communication (Critical)**
   - **Finding**: All application traffic uses HTTP without encryption.
   - **Risk**: Sensitive data transmitted in plaintext can be intercepted.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement HTTPS using proper certificates. Configure AWS Load Balancer with TLS termination.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

2. **Overly Permissive Security Groups (Critical)**
   - **Finding**: Security groups allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to multiple ports.
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to application and monitoring services.
   - **Recommendation**: Restrict access to specific IP ranges. Use a bastion host for administrative access.
   - **Status**: Partially Mitigated

3. **Container Security Issues (High)**
   - **Finding**: Containers run with default privileges and outdated base images.
   - **Risk**: Container breakout or exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - **Recommendation**: Use non-root users in containers, implement security contexts, and use up-to-date base images.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

### Medium Issues

4. **Missing Web Application Firewall (Medium)**
   - **Finding**: No WAF protection against common attacks.
   - **Risk**: Vulnerable to XSS, SQL injection, and other common web attacks.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement AWS WAF with rules for OWASP Top 10 protection.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

5. **Authentication Concerns (Medium)**
   - **Finding**: Default credentials used for Grafana admin account.
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to monitoring data.
   - **Recommendation**: Change default credentials and implement SSO or more robust authentication.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

6. **Logging Gaps (Medium)**
   - **Finding**: Insufficient security-related logging.
   - **Risk**: Inability to detect and investigate security incidents.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement centralized logging with security event monitoring.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

### Low Issues

7. **Dependency Management (Low)**
   - **Finding**: No automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies.
   - **Risk**: Using libraries with known vulnerabilities.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

8. **Lack of Security Headers (Low)**
   - **Finding**: Missing HTTP security headers (CSP, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
   - **Risk**: Increased vulnerability to client-side attacks.
   - **Recommendation**: Add appropriate security headers to all HTTP responses.
   - **Status**: Not Implemented

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Immediate Action Required**
   - Implement HTTPS with proper certificates
   - Restrict security group access to necessary sources
   - Fix container security issues

2. **Near-term Improvements**
   - Implement WAF protection
   - Strengthen authentication mechanisms
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for security events

3. **Long-term Controls**
   - Regular security scanning for dependencies
   - Security header implementation
   - Regular security training for team members

## Remediation Plan

| Finding | Severity | Remediation | Timeline | Owner |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Insecure Communication | Critical | Implement HTTPS | 1 week | Iskakov Amir |
| Permissive Security Groups | Critical | Restrict access | 1 week | Zholtaev Temirlan |
| Container Security | High | Implement security contexts | 2 weeks | Iskakov Amir |
| Missing WAF | Medium | Configure AWS WAF | 3 weeks | Zholtaev Temirlan |
| Authentication Concerns | Medium | Update credentials & add SSO | 2 weeks | Iskakov Amir |
| Logging Gaps | Medium | Implement centralized logging | 4 weeks | Zholtaev Temirlan |
| Dependency Management | Low | Add dependency scanning | 4 weeks | Iskakov Amir |
| Security Headers | Low | Configure security headers | 3 weeks | Zholtaev Temirlan |

## Conclusion

The SRE Demo Application requires significant security improvements before it can be considered production-ready. The critical and high-priority issues should be addressed immediately, while medium and low issues should be included in the short-term development roadmap.

This audit demonstrates the importance of integrating security throughout the application lifecycle and addressing issues early in the development process.
