## Project Overview

This project demonstrates Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles applied to a simple web application. We have created a basic web service with monitoring, alerting, and automated deployment to showcase our understanding of SRE concepts.

## Components

1. **Web Application** - A simple Flask API with a React frontend
2. **Infrastructure as Code** - Using Terraform to provision resources
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
4. **Monitoring & Alerting** - Prometheus and Grafana setup
5. **Security Audit** - Analysis of potential vulnerabilities
6. **Capacity Planning** - Simulation of increasing load
7. **Custom SRE Tool** - A simple script to automate repetitive tasks
